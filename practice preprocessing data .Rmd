This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r load example data}


```ˆˆ
```{r handeling missing data}
#Drop rows containing NA’s in ... columns.
drop_na(x, x2)
#Fill in NA’s in ... columns with most recent non-NA values.
fill(x, ..., .direction = c("down", "up"))
#Replace NA by column 
replace_na(x, list(x2 = 2))
```
```{r split cells}
Split Cells

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
