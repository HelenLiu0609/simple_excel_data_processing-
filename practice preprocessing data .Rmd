This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r daily self care}
library("praise")
praise()
```


```{r load data and view using "glimpse"}
my_data <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Group coding sheet_updated_08.05.csv")
library(dplyr)
view(my_data)
glimpse(my_data)
```
```{r used package}
#Tidy Data with "tidyr"
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
# structuring sequences of data operations with "magrittr" %>% 
library(magrittr)
```
```{r pick roles}
#pick roles 2,3,4,5 
need_data <- my_data[,c(2,3,4,5)]
view(need_data)
# or other ways is c("name","",....)
#
# drop example lines 1,2,3
need_data_drop <- need_data %>% slice(-c(1, 2, 3))
view(need_data_drop)
```
```{r reshape data}
# gather and spread function：reorganize the values of a table into a new layout
gather(need_data_drop, `1999`, `2000`, key = "year", value = "cases")
spread(table2, type, count)
```
```{r handling missing data}
#Drop rows containing NA’s in x2 columns.
drop_na(x, x2)
#Replace NA by column 
replace_na(x, list(x2 = 2))
```
```{r split cells/seperate roles}
#separate first author and last author
new_data <- separate(need_data_drop, Author, sep = ";", into = c("first author", "last author"))
# put together two roles 
unite(new_data, "first author", Year, col = "article", sep = ",")
```
```
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
